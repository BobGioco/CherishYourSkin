            <p class="text text--dark"><span class="text--highlight-secondary">The epidermis</span> is the outermost layer of the skin, which serves as the main barrier between our body and the external environment. It is mainly composed of <span class="text--highlight-secondary">keratinocytes</span>, which are constantly shed and replaced by new cells from the lower layer of the epidermis. The epidermis also contains <span class="text--highlight-secondary">melanocytes</span>, which produce the pigment melanin that gives our skin its color.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Beneath the epidermis lies <span class="text--highlight-secondary">the dermis</span>, where we find blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. The dermis is composed of <span class="text--highlight-secondary">collagen and elastin fibers</span>, which provide the skin with strength and elasticity. It is also rich in <span class="text--highlight-secondary">hyaluronic acid</span>, a substance that helps keep our skin hydrated and plump.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark"><span class="text--highlight-secondary">The hypodermis</span>, also known as the subcutaneous layer, is the deepest layer of the skin. It is mainly composed of <span class="text--highlight-secondary">adipose cells</span> and <span class="text--highlight-secondary">connective tissue</span> and serves as a cushion that helps protect our internal organs and bones. The hypodermis also helps regulate our body temperature by providing insulation against the cold.</p>
