            <p class="text text--dark">If you don’t have any specific skin concern, but want to elevate your skincare routine as a prevention</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">If you get lost in the number of products on the market and want to use what really works</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">If you have certain characteristics of your skin that you want to target: dryness, oiliness, starting wrinkles, pigmentation, redness</p>

            <p class="text text--dark text--no-padding-bottom">If you’re struggling with conditions such as eczema or rosacea</p>

            <h2 class="text text--highlight-primary">How does it work?</h2>

            <p class="text text--dark">1. Once you book the service, you’ll get a confirmation email with billing information</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">2. After proceeding with payment, calendar with available dates for booking an online appointment will be open for you</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">3. Along with booking dates, you’ll get access to detailed questionnaire that you will need to fill in and provide by the date that will be indicated in the email
            </p>

            <p class="text text--dark">4. One hour video call will follow where we will discuss in detail your answers and I’ll be providing explanation on the approach that we will take in your new skincare routine</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">5. Within three days after our call, you’ll receive a protocol with your new routine for morning and evening where each step will be explained to you along with some important useful tips</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">6. You’ll have a two weeks email support where I’ll answer any of your questions about products or your skin</p>

            <p class="text text--dark text--no-padding-bottom">7. Two months after the end of the email support, we’ll have another 30 minutes video call in order to check in on your progress (as it takes approximately two months before we can see some consistent results) and potentially do some changes in products to assure they fit your individual needs in the best way possible</p>
