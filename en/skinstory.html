        <div class="story-content__text-container">

            <p class="text text--dark text--first-paragraph">Skin is an important organ of our body and plays a key role in maintaining our health. Its main function is to act as a protective barrier that keeps good things in and bad things out. It is the body's first immune response to external factors such as microbes. It also protects us from harmful UV rays and mechanical injuries.</p>

           <p class="text text--dark">In addition to its protective functions, skin also plays a role in thermoregulation. Our skin also helps prevent water loss from our body. It has a natural barrier that keeps moisture inside and thus prevents dehydration. However, this barrier can be disrupted by inappropriate selection of cosmetic products and improper application procedures.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Another way in which our skin protects us is by fighting microbes. Skin has its own microbiome, which is a set of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live on the surface of the skin. These microorganisms help protect the skin from harmful bacteria by competing for nutrients and space.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark text--new-section">Skin has a complex structure, consisting of three main layers: the epidermis (outer layer), the dermis (middle layer), and the hypodermis (innermost layer).</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, which serves as the main barrier between our body and the external environment. It is mainly composed of keratinocytes, which are constantly shed and replaced by new cells from the lower layer of the epidermis. The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin that gives our skin its color.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Beneath the epidermis lies the dermis, where we find blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. The dermis is composed of collagen and elastin fibers, which provide the skin with strength and elasticity. It is also rich in hyaluronic acid, a substance that helps keep our skin hydrated and plump.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">The hypodermis, also known as the subcutaneous layer, is the deepest layer of the skin. It is mainly composed of adipose cells and connective tissue and serves as a cushion that helps protect our internal organs and bones. The hypodermis also helps regulate our body temperature by providing insulation against the cold.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark text--new-section">Overall, the structure of our skin is a complex and dynamic system that allows it to perform a wide range of functions while protecting us. Can we then act on all skin structures and processes by using cosmetic products in home care? Unfortunately, the answer is no, we cannot. As I mentioned earlier, the skin serves as a barrier that doesn't allow much to pass through it. Therefore, when we apply a product, it usually acts mainly on the outermost layer, composed of layers of dead cells, otherwise known as the stratum corneum. This layer is most exposed to various influences, and therefore we must protect it the most to ensure it continues to function properly. Simply put, it's mutual protection. With an awareness of how important this layer is for our health, a new scientific field called "corneology" emerged in the late 20th century. The term "corneotherapy" was first used in Germany in 1980. The development of this field approximately thirty years ago led to a breakthrough in the cosmetic industry. Modern cosmetic product development heavily relies on knowledge gained from corneology. To understand what products I have in mind, let's take a look together at the main findings of corneology, which can be divided into four main areas:</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">One of the key functions of the stratum corneum is to maintain a slightly acidic pH. This pH is important for maintaining the health of the skin microbiome. The skin microbiome is a collection of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mites) that live on our skin. A healthy microbiome is important for protecting the skin from harmful bacteria and maintaining overall skin health.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Another important function of this layer is to maintain a balanced composition of water and lipids. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is the amount of water that evaporates through the skin's surface. Maintaining a healthy balance of water and oils in the horny layer can help reduce TEWL, thus preventing dryness and dehydration.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Proper desquamation of dead skin cells is also important for maintaining healthy skin. Desquamation is the process of shedding dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. When this process is disrupted, it can lead to a buildup of dead cells, which can clog pores and lead to acne and a dull complexion. Accelerating the process of desquamation, on the other hand, can cause a lack of dead cells, leading to conditions such as atopic dermatitis.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">And finally, we must not forget that our bodies are exposed to oxidative stress every day, with the main factors being UV radiation, air pollution, or stress. Therefore, it is important to regularly provide our skin with antioxidants to fight free radicals as effectively as possible.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark text--new-section">In order to set up the correct home skincare routine, we must be able to properly identify what to focus on in product selection, so that we use products that are suitable and effective specifically for our skin. Taking care of our skin is important not only from an aesthetic perspective but above all for our health. Our skin deserves it just like other organs in our body. If you need to quickly orient yourself in product selection, take advantage of one of the virtual consultations I offer. I'll be happy to prepare a tailor-made routine for you.</p>
