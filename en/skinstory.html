        <div class="story-content__text-container">

            <p class="text text--dark text--first-paragraph">Skin in my (very subjective) view is the most fascinating organ of our body. We often forget what important function it plays in our lives. Alongside its role as a protective barrier, the skin helps people maintain the right internal temperature and allows them to sense the world through nerve endings.</p>

           <p class="text text--dark">Skin is a complex organ. An average square inch of skin contains 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, and more than 1,000 nerve endings. Despite being just a few millimeters thick, the skin makes up around one-seventhTrusted Source of a person's body weight.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">As a person gets older, their skin changes. It becomes thinner and more easily damaged. The epidermis becomes slower at replacing dead skin cells and the process of healing slows. Overall, a person will have less skin, and it becomes less elastic. Older adults may find that their skin becomes more dry, irritated, and thin. The skin may itch more, bruise, and become infected more easily.</p>
