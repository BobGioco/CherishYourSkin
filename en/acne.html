            <p class="text text--dark text--first-paragraph">Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.</p>
            
            <p class="text text--dark">Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).</p>

            <p class="text text--dark">For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.</p>
